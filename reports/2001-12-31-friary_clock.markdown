#### Meeting Report ####

The Society's Christmas Social Evening was held at St. Mary's Centre on Friday 7<sup>th</sup> December and as in previous years it was a most enjoyable evening. It is unusual, to say the least, to have a speaker provide the entertainment on these occasions but Colin Walton's subject and his style of presentation was admirably suited to the evening. Colin, it transpired, had difficulty living facing the Clock Tower in the Friary - a clock that never indicated the correct time, never chimed correctly and gradually became a source of annoyance. His approach to dealing with the situation was simple and straightforward - to offer to take over the maintenance of the clock, an offer not surprisingly gratefully accepted by the Council. Colin aided by his son have spent many hours and much hard work in bringing the clock and its workings into a good state of repair and today the clock shows the right time and chimes when it should. Colin can now sleep peacefully at night and we, the citizens of Lichfield, have benefited from his efforts. If you are interested in finding out more about the Clock Tower, Colin has a web site at: [www.towerclocks.co.uk](http://www.towerclocks.co.uk) - our thanks to Colin for providing the evening's entertainment. 

Grateful thanks are also due to all those members of the Society who so generously provided a delicious range of food and desirable raffle prizes. I hope that all those who attended enjoyed this slightly unusual but memorable evening.
