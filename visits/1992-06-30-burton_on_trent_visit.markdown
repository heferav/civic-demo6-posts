#### Visit Report ####

Twenty-one members visited St Paul's Church, Burton-on-Trent, on Tuesday 23<sup>rd</sup> June and were welcomed by the Vicar. Following a most knowledgeable introduction by our Chairman, Alan Thompson, we proceeded on a tour of the Church. 

We entered the Chancel through a fine metal screen before which was, to the north side a splendid stone pulpit with a canopy and to the south an unusual but majestic brass lectern. The barrel roof was ornamented but the beautiful east window was partially obscured by the carved reredos. In the front of the altar were five pendant sanctuary lamps which had come from the East. The vestry and passage to the north side accommodated choir robes in large oak cupboards decorated with linen-fold carving and opened by decorative metal hinges. An altar furnished the north transept from where one could marvel at the fine organ pipes in the south transept, the like of which can probably only be found in continental cathedrals. The Lady Chapel was accommodated in the south aisle and contained an enormous oak chest for vestments. 

The nave has been foreshortened with oak screening in order that the west end may be used as a hall. Here we were regaled with coffee and biscuits, kindly served by two ladies who were delighted to show us their excellent modern kitchen and to tell us of all the meals they serve to the community each week. 

This is a patron's church that was built with funding from the Bass family in the middle of the last century. Everyone present was impressed by the beauty of the building -- a veritable small cathedral -- which is passed every day by many who are unaware of the wealth and beauty that lies therein.
